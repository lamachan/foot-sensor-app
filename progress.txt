done:
* redis data fetching
* multiple sensors
* multiple patients
* patient info
* line graphs for all sensors
* pages
* custom component boilerplate
* custom component circles (changing colours and sizes)
* anomaly history for 1 patient

problems:
* timeouts during fetching data
* duplicate data (by trace id)
* missing data points (by trace id)

to do:
* anomaly history for concurrent patients
* custom component feet diagram
* fetching ready data from redis at app start (more that just 1 row) [MAYBE]
* nice layout
* homepages
