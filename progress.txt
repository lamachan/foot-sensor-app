done:
* redis data fetching
* multiple sensors
* multiple patients
* patient info
* line graphs for all sensors

problems:
* timeouts during fetching data
* duplicate data (by trace id)
* missing data points (by trace id)

to do:
* custom component
* fetching ready data from redis at app start (more that just 1 row) [MAYBE]
* nice layout
