done:
* redis data fetching
* multiple sensors
* multiple patients
* patient info
* line graphs for all sensors
* pages
* custom component boilerplate
* custom component circles (changing colours and sizes)
* anomaly history for 1 patient* anomaly history for concurrent patients
* timestamped data
* anomaly streak separation in live data

problems:
* timeouts during fetching data
* duplicate data (by trace id)
* missing data points (by trace id)
* anomaly history streak order (buttons)

to do:
* custom component feet diagram (draw feet image, import feet image, place circles in the right places)
* fetching ready data from redis at app start (more that just 1 row) [MAYBE - CONSULT WITH SZMUR≈ÅO]
* nice layout (homepages, patient pages)
* docker
* documentation (user manual + architecture description)
* report (design - NOTION)
